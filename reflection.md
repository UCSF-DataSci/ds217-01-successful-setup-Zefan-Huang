# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
[Tell us a bit about yourself - your field of study, professional background, interests, or anything else you'd like to share]
Hi there. My name is Zefan Huang. I'm first year health data science student at UCSF. My interest is using deep learning/machine learning to develop/predict disease state. I have some expereince in using CNN and U-net in medical image segmentation. I love to test the advanced tech and skills, and bring them into the health area. In the meantime, I like traveling and photography.

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
[What do you hope to gain? Specific skills, knowledge, applications, career goals?]
In this class, I want to refine my Python skill and check for omissions. My career goal is become a data scientist and currectly I'm considering applying for Phd in Bio + AI.


## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
[What excites you about programming/data science? What concerns or uncertainties do you have?]
I do like coding(at least for now). The best part about coding is I can quickly implement an idea instead looking for lots of hardware. Especailly right now, LLM can make this idea even more mature. I'm a bit concern about vibe coding with the growing of the LLM.


## 4. Share something you enjoy!
[Drop a link to something you really enjoy - could be a website, article, video, project, hobby, book, podcast, or anything else you're into]
